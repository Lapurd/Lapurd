Lapurd is a reverse spelling of 'Drupal'!

It is PHP framework with Drupal-like modular system, which borrows a lot
goodies from Drupal, but aims to be more programmer friendly and built on
modern PHP technologies.

The design goals are:

* Follow PSR standards

* Drupal-like modular system

* Use composer manage dependence
